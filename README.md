# Intraday-Commodity-Futures-Quantitative-Strategy
This is a CTA strategy.
Developed a generalizable intraday trading strategy for commodity futures, adaptable to products with varying volatility levels, achieving stabilized returns.

Built a multi-factor dynamic scoring model integrating cost and trend factors to generate signals, employing an ATR-based chandelier exit for risk control, and conducted backtesting and parameter optimization across different volatility regimes.
Achieved a Sharpe ratio >1 in backtests using nearly 3 years of historical data.

First run the atr.ipynb file. Next, indicator.ipynb to compute all the indicators. Finally, do the backtest with backtest.ipynb file.
